# Pigment over glow

When the owner says the site looks "flat", "bland", or "foggy", the root cause is
**stacked cyan glow + layered backdrop-blur desaturating and flattening contrast**, NOT
the wrong hue and NOT that surfaces are too dark.

**The fix (owner-confirmed "yes exactly"):**
- Increase **saturation** and **contrast**, and **lower brightness** (deepen blacks) so the
  cerulean reads as *pigment*, not a milky wash.
- **Reduce** the glow: fewer/weaker cyan coronas (outer + the doubled inset corona), and pull
  back the ~25 `backdrop-filter: blur() saturate()` layers that compound into haze across nested
  surfaces (page bg → panel → card → inner tile).
- Do NOT "add more light/glow" to fix flatness — that is the cause, not the cure.

**Why:** Owner edited the landing hero in their own photo editor (saturation+contrast up,
brightness down) and showed a side-by-side; the more-pigmented version killed the fog. Confirmed
the diagnosis directly.

**How to apply:**
- Hero/backdrop images live on `.study-page-bg::before` (in-app = `app-smoke.jpg`) and
  `.landing-root.study-page-bg::before` (landing = `brain-clouds.jpg`). Correct them with a CSS
  `filter: saturate() contrast() brightness()` on the `::before` (started landing-only at
  saturate(1.32) contrast(1.12) brightness(0.9) as an apples-to-apples test before site-wide).
- Roll out in two phases: (1) backdrop image filter, (2) reduce surface glow/blur on
  cards/buttons/panels. Keep hue locked (--surf-hue 192) so check-surface-hue + check-design-drift
  stay green — a filter adds no color literals, so guardrails are unaffected.
